            <h6>RECITATIVE AND DUET—CASILDA AND LUIZ.</h6> 
            <p> O rapture, when alone together
                Two loving hearts and those that bear them
           May join in temporary tether,
                Though Fate apart should rudely tear them.</p>

 <h6>CAS.</h6>      <p>Necessity, Invention's mother,
                Compelled me to a course of feigning—
           But, left alone with one another,
                I will atone for my disdaining!</p>

                                <h6>AIR</h6>

 <h6>CAS.</h6>                    <p> Ah, well-beloved,
                          Mine angry frown
                          Is but a gown
                          That serves to dress
                          My gentleness!</p>

 <h6>LUIZ.</h6>                  <p> Ah, well-beloved,
                          Thy cold disdain,
                          It gives no pain—
                          'Tis mercy, played
                          In masquerade!</p>

 <h6>BOTH.</h6>                    <p>Ah, well-beloved, etc.</p>

      <h6>CAS.</h6>  <p>O Luiz, Luiz—what have you said?  What have I done?
 What have I allowed you to do?</p>
      <h6>LUIZ.</h6>  <p>Nothing, I trust, that you will ever have reason to
 repent.</p>  <p>(Offering to embrace her.)</p>
      <h6>CAS.</h6> <p>(withdrawing from him).</p>  <p>Nay, Luiz, it may not be.  I
 have embraced you for the last time.</p>
      <h6>LUIZ</h6> <p>(amazed).</p>  <p>Casilda!</p>
