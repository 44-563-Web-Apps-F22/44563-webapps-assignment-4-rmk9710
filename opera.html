            <h6>RECITATIVE AND DUET—CASILDA AND LUIZ.  O rapture, when alone together
                Two loving hearts and those that bear them
           May join in temporary tether,
                Though Fate apart should rudely tear them.

 CAS.      Necessity, Invention's mother,
                Compelled me to a course of feigning—
           But, left alone with one another,
                I will atone for my disdaining!

                                AIR

 CAS.                     Ah, well-beloved,
                          Mine angry frown
                          Is but a gown
                          That serves to dress
                          My gentleness!

 LUIZ.                    Ah, well-beloved,
                          Thy cold disdain,
                          It gives no pain—
                          'Tis mercy, played
                          In masquerade!

 BOTH.                    Ah, well-beloved, etc.

      CAS.  O Luiz, Luiz—what have you said?  What have I done?
 What have I allowed you to do?
      LUIZ.  Nothing, I trust, that you will ever have reason to
 repent.  (Offering to embrace her.)
      CAS. (withdrawing from him).  Nay, Luiz, it may not be.  I
 have embraced you for the last time.
      LUIZ (amazed).  Casilda!</h6>
